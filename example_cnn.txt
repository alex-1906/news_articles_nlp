"This is genocide."  That's how Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the shocking images of at least 20 civilian men's bodies strewn across the street in Bucha, northwest of the capital of Kyiv, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities, including the horrific images of dead civilians captured by Agence France-Presse, are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital. "The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities," Zelensky said Sunday on CBS News' "Face the Nation" when asked if Russia is carrying out genocide. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths. Russia responds. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the extensive footage of dead bodies in Bucha was "fake," saying "not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions," during Russia's occupation of Bucha. State Department spokesperson Ned Price, meanwhile, hinted at additional US action against Russia coming "very soon" when asked about Zelensky's request for greater G7 sanctions in response to the latest alleged atrocities in Bucha. This is not a "real withdrawal of Russian forces," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said, warning that attacks in Ukraine will continue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has blamed Wladimir Putin for the killings inside the district, accusing Moscow of trying to put an end to his "whole nation." Ukraine's military has accused Russia of starting a covert mobilisation of reservists. Russia's Vladimir Putin had earlier said he would not send reservist troops to fight in Ukraine
